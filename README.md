# Kerry’s vim config

Started out pretty minimal, but has inevitably bloated a bit.

Primarily targetted at Elixir development, but also other bits and bobs that
I’ve found handy. Includes language server integration using
[CoC](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim).

I’ve tried to comment `vimrc` enough to make it reasonably comprehensible.
